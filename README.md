## Task
>Develop a software architecture for the control of the robot in the environment. The software will rely on the move_base
and gmapping packages for localizing the robot and plan the motion.
The architecture should be able to get the user request, and let the robot execute one of the following behaviors
(depending on the userâ€™s input):
 1) autonomously reach a x,y coordinate inserted by the user
 2) let the user drive the robot with the keyboard
 3) let the user drive the robot assisting them to avoid collisions.


## Installing and running

Run the program with:

```bash
$ roslaunch final_assignment assignment.launch
```

>For compiling and running, you need the `xterm` package; you can install it with:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install xterm
```

### Autonomous driving

>For autonomously driving the robot, the program sends a goal to the action server */move_base*, receiving feedbacks and monitoring the status until the goal is reached or canceled.
 Thanks to the *gmapping* algorithm, the robot can create a map of the surrounding environment during its tours. The `move_base` node implements the action server to control the robot through the shortest path to reach the given position.
 The user can also require to cancel the current goal or to send a new one.
 The `driving_mode` node asks the user to insert the goal with the `ask_for_goal` function.

### Free drive

>The function used to implement the free drive modality is in the `free_drive.py` file. It publishes the robot's speed on the topic */cmd_vel* each time the user inputs a command.

### Driver assistance

>The driver assistance modality uses the `driver_assistance` node, described in the second assignment, slightly changed to be turned on and off when it is used or not. For this reason, the code of the node is written in C++.
>The `client_drive_assistance.py` file contains the function to send a request to the `driver_assistance` node through the Command service, defined in the `srv` folder.

### User interface

>The user interface of the program is in `user_interface.py`. It is implemented with the *curses* library, dividing the terminal into windows and calling specific functions to print strings and receive user inputs.
 The class `windows_organiser` stores all information about the user interface and implements some modes to make the code slighter.
