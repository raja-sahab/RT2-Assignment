.. module:: driving_mode
    :platform: Unix
    :synopsis: Python module for choosing the driving modality.

.. moduleauthor:: Raja Farooq Dilshad

This node allows the user to choose the drive modality between:

* :mod:`autonomous_driving`

* :mod:`free_drive`

* :mod:`driver_assistance`

It uses the user interface defined in the :mod:`user_interface` module.
According to the user's choice, it gives the control to the corresponding module, and shows results on screen.
